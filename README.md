# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Repository created to develop a site that utilizes a weather API to show the current weather in a city and the 5 day forecast. Previous searches are saved to local storage. Clicking a previously search city causes the city weather to be displayed. The most recently searched city will be displayed when visiting the site.

## Live site:

See Git files

## Usage

The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, javascript, Bootstrap. and access APIs.

## Credits

I created this code based on the homework prompt. Pieces of code I used online resources for help including following videos depicting functions.

## Challenges

For this project I ran into some issues with how to follow along with the resouce used and to make it fuction as my own. Focusing on the next project and topics in class and balencing this was a challenge as well.
